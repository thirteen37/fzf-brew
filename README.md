# Homebrew commands enhanced with fzf

## Usage

You can either use the convenient aliases or triggered completions.

The following aliases are defined:

* `fbi`: Fuzzy brew install
* `fbui`: Fuzzy brew uninstall
* `fci`: Fuzzy cask install
* `fcui`: Fuzzy cask uninstall

You can specify a search parameter, e.g., `fbi git` will start your search with `git`.

Alternatively, you can use use the fzf trigger with `tab`. The default trigger is `**`. Hence the following command will work `brew install git**<tab>`. Casks can be installed with `brew install --cask **`

Obviously, I prefer the much shorter aliases.

## Additional functionality

Multiple options can be selected using `shift-tab` by default.

Previews will show `brew info` for the selected formula or package.

You can visit the homepage of the formula or cask using `ctrl-space`.
